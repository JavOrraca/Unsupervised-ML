# Unsupervised Machine Learning

This exercise relies on the k-means algorithm to perform unsupervised machine learning for clustering via the R programming language.

## Prerequisites

Software and tools:
* R notebook (I recommend Jupyter or RStudio)
* dplyr package - used for data manipulation
* ade4 package - used for converting categorical data into numerical dummy data
* stats package - part of R Core 

## Data

The data used in this analysis reflects a historical snapshot of publicly available Sun Country Airlines data used for educational purposes. This repository will not cover the data cleanup phase. We'll begin with a data set that has been pre-processed and sanitized for the purpose of clustering in R. 

## Running the code

This clustering exercise can be summarized into four major parts:
  1. Data preparation
  2. Converting categorical data into numerical data
  3. Analyzing k-means clusters via sum of squared errors (SSE) comparison 
  4. Cluster assignment in data set
