# Unsupervised Machine Learning

This exercise relies on the k-means algorithm to perform unsupervised machine learning for clustering via the R programming language.

## Prerequisites

* [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/): Allows for R environment installation, including Jupyter setup
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/): Web-based R notebook that can be launched via the Anaconda Navigator and natively reads .ipynb files
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): This R package is for data manipulation and is part of the tidyverse R toolset
* [ade4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ade4/index.html): This R package can used for converting categorical data into numerical dummy data and for multivariate data analysis

## Data

The data used in this analysis reflects a historical snapshot of Sun Country Airlines data used for educational purposes. This repository will not cover the full data cleanup and sanitization process. We'll start with a pre-processed data set ready for clustering via R. 

## Running the code

This clustering exercise can be summarized into four major parts:
  1. Data preparation
  2. Converting categorical data into numerical data
  3. Analyzing k-means clusters via sum of squared errors (SSE) comparison 
  4. Cluster assignment in data set
